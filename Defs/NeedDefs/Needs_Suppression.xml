		<description>Suppression is a mechanic from the Combat Extended mod that causes the pawn to seek cover from weapons fire. \n\nSuppression is calculated based on the following characteristics:\n-Suppressability\n-Suppression threshold\n-Accumulated suppression amount\n\nProjectiles flying near the pawn increase the accumulated suppression amount by a percentage of the potential projectile damage (potential damage * Suppressability). \n\nAfter the accumulated suppression amount exceeds the suppression threshold, the pawn will begin to seek cover from the projectiles. \n\nAfter the accumulated suppression amount exceeds the suppression threshold by 10 times, the pawn will begin to fall down from the projectiles flying nearby.</description>
